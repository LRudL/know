    "content": "You are a helpful socratic tutor guiding a learner through various concepts. You are given the ground truth document that contains information about all concepts, and a list of \"knowledge nodes\" that the learner wants to learn about the document. You should ask questions to the user to help them learn the concept nodes, and give them feedback on their responses. Your questions should be clear, such that the answer is unambiguous. Imagine you are asking Anki flashcard questions. You should not mention the existence of nodes to the user, except for when emitting \"tags\" or within <thinking> tags, neither of which will be shown to the user.\n\nEach node is equipped with an id, summary, content and supporting quotes from the original document. You will be given a list of nodes that the learner has already learned at least once, that they should review. You will also be given a list of nodes that the learner has not yet learned, that they should learn. Reviews can be briefer than concepts that the user has not yet learned. \n\nYou have judgement over which nodes should be addressed, and in what order. You should try and ensure the reader understand the more basic concepts before progressing to the more complex ones. Your goal is to maximise the learner's understanding of the document. The learner can go on tangents, but you should try to keep them focused on the main concepts. \n\nIn this environment you have access to a tool called \"node_complete\". You should use this tool when you wish to move on to to teaching a new topic, and after the user has satisfactorily answered, or spent significant effort on, a node. You can pass in a judgement of \"easy\", \"good\", \"hard\" or \"failed\". Upon using this tool, you will be returned a new set of nodes to choose from.\n\nHere is the document content:\n2/3/22, 9:31 PM The Bitter Lesson\nwww .incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html 1/2The Bitter Lesson\nRich Sutton\nMarch 13, 2019\n \nThe biggest lesson that can be r ead fr om 70 years of AI r esear ch is that general methods that leverage\ncomputation ar e ultimately the most ef fective, and by a lar ge mar gin. The ultimate r eason for this is\nMoor e's law , or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of\ncomputation. Most AI r esear ch has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent wer e\nconstant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to impr ove\nperformance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical r esear ch pr oject, massively mor e\ncomputation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an impr ovement that makes a dif ference in the\nshorter term, r esear chers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing\nthat matters in the long r un is the leveraging of computation. These two need not r un counter to each\nother , but in practice they tend to. T ime spent on one is time not spent on the other . Ther e are\npsychological commitments to investment in one appr oach or the other . And the human-knowledge\nappr oach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of\ngeneral methods leveraging computation.\u00a0 Ther e wer e many examples of AI r esear chers' belated\nlearning of this bitter lesson, and it is instr uctive to r eview some of the most pr ominent.\n \nIn computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kaspar ov, in 1997, wer e based on\nmassive, deep sear ch. At the time, this was looked upon with dismay by the majority of computer -\nchess r esear chers who had pursued methods that leveraged human understanding of the special\nstructur e of chess. When a simpler , sear ch-based appr oach with special har dwar e and softwar e proved\nvastly mor e effective, these human-knowledge-based chess r esear chers wer e not good losers. They\nsaid that ``br ute for ce\" sear ch may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy , and anyway it\nwas not how people played chess. These r esear chers wanted methods based on human input to win\nand wer e disappointed when they did not.\n \nA similar pattern of r esear ch pr ogress was seen in computer Go, only delayed by a further 20 years.\nEnormous initial ef forts went into avoiding sear ch by taking advantage of human knowledge, or of\nthe special featur es of the game, but all those ef forts pr oved irr elevant, or worse, once sear ch was\napplied ef fectively at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self play to learn a value\nfunction (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did not play a big r ole in\nthe 1997 pr ogram that \ufb01rst beat a world champion). Learning by self play , and learning in general, is\nlike sear ch in that it enables massive computation to be br ought to bear . Sear ch and learning ar e the\ntwo most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI r esear ch.\nIn computer Go, as in computer chess, r esear chers' initial ef fort was dir ected towar ds utilizing human\nunderstanding (so that less sear ch was needed) and only much later was much gr eater success had by\nembracing sear ch and learning.\n \nIn speech r ecognition, ther e was an early competition, sponsor ed by DARP A, in the 1970s. Entrants\nincluded a host of special methods that took advantage of human knowledge---knowledge of wor ds,\nof phonemes, of the human vocal tract, etc. On the other side wer e newer methods that wer e mor e\nstatistical in natur e and did much mor e computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs).\nAgain, the statistical methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major\nchange in all of natural language pr ocessing, gradually over decades, wher e statistics and\ncomputation came to dominate the \ufb01eld. The r ecent rise of deep learning in speech r ecognition is the\nmost r ecent step in this consistent dir ection. Deep learning methods r ely even less on human\nknowledge, and use even mor e computation, together with learning on huge training sets, to pr oduce\ndramatically better speech r ecognition systems. As in the games, r esear chers always tried to make\nsystems that worked the way the r esear chers thought their own minds worked---they tried to put that\nknowledge in their systems---but it pr oved ultimately counterpr oductive, and a colossal waste of\n2/3/22, 9:31 PM The Bitter Lesson\nwww .incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html 2/2resear cher's time, when, thr ough Moor e's law , massive computation became available and a means\nwas found to put it to good use.\nIn computer vision, ther e has been a similar pattern. Early methods conceived of vision as sear ching\nfor edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT featur es. But today all this is discar ded.\nModern deep-learning neural networks use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of\ninvariances, and perform much better .\nThis is a big lesson. As a \ufb01eld, we still have not thor oughly learned it, as we ar e continuing to make\nthe same kind of mistakes. T o see this, and to ef fectively r esist it, we have to understand the appeal of\nthese mistakes. W e have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not\nwork in the long r un. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI r esear chers\nhave often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is\npersonally satisfying to the r esear cher, but 3) in the long r un it plateaus and even inhibits further\nprogress, and 4) br eakthr ough pr ogress eventually arrives by an opposing appr oach based on scaling\ncomputation by sear ch and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often\nincompletely digested, because it is success over a favor ed, human-centric appr oach. \nOne thing that should be learned fr om the bitter lesson is the gr eat power of general purpose methods,\nof methods that continue to scale with incr eased computation even as the available computation\nbecomes very gr eat. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way ar e sear ch and learning . \nThe second general point to be learned fr om the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds ar e\ntremendously , irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to \ufb01nd simple ways to think about the\ncontents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries.\nAll these ar e part of the arbitrary , intrinsically-complex, outside world. They ar e not what should be\nbuilt in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can \ufb01nd\nand captur e this arbitrary complexity . Essential to these methods is that they can \ufb01nd good\nappr oximations, but the sear ch for them should be by our methods, not by us. W e want AI agents that\ncan discover like we can, not which contain what we have discover ed. Building in our discoveries\nonly makes it har der to see how the discovering pr ocess can be done.\n\nHere are the nodes to choose from to address in this session. You should only choose one node to address.\n\nNODES TO ADDRESS:\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"content\": \"The fundamental principle that general methods leveraging computation are ultimately the most effective in AI, by a large margin.

    "content": "The key difference lies in how these methods improve:  Computation-based methods: - Learn patterns directly from data - Improve automatically with more computing power - Example: Modern chess engines that learn strategies through millions of games  Knowledge-based methods: - Rely on hand-coded rules and expertise - Require human intervention to improve - Example: Early chess programs with grandmaster-designed evaluation functions  A clear illustration: In computer vision, traditional approaches used carefully designed filters to detect specific features (knowledge-based). Modern deep learning instead learns these features automatically from data with sufficient compute (computation-based). The latter approach scaled better and ultimately achieved superior performance."
